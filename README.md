#OK, let's cut to the chase here

I bet that you saw the screenshots or played the game, whatever, and you saw that this doesn't look like what I just described right now, which made you ask yourself: "what the hell is this mod actually about" or "what I just played" and "why I got recommended to play this?" or even "how long is the description? Does this thing have a world limit or something?".

This mod is basically like a mix between SiIvaGunner's Rips and stuff like Games Repainted or FNF but BAD, a full overhaul of the base game, but shitpost (and also some weird experiments I would like to do)

This is what the mod actually have (or will have):

- **All of the visual remade (I didn't say they were good or not)**
- **YTPooped the entire soundtrack (Is that even a term? anyways)**
- **Rewritten stuff like score and dialogue (Basically I changed the text)**
- **All of the Charts are left Intact (at the very least in the boyfriend's turn)**

**REMEMBER TO LEAVE A FEEDBACK OF THE MOD, IT HELPS A LOT**

# **FAQ**

**Q: How long did this took to make?**

A: Longer that It should have been.

**Q: When the rest of the mod (AKA: Week 4 - 6) comes out ?**

A: I would say the dumb line "When itâ€™s ready", but, to be honest it's almost done, I need to do 2 Things

1. I just need to find a way to get a copy of Adobe Animate running, since I have been using the free trial to export the sprites (NO, I will not buy a subscription to use a simple export command).

2. Finish Editing the Soundtrack, I have plans to edit the soundtrack, even something as simple as changing the vocals of a character.

**Q: Wait if you didn't used Adobe Animate what software did you used to edit the sprites?**

A: Simple, I used a older version of Adobe Animate: Adobe Flash CS5.5 Professional (Trust me, this helps a lot and you can get one on Internet Archive ) and also Gimp

**Q: Is this mod related to GTA Definitive Edition?**

A: no, it's just a coincidence and bad timing

**Q: What about the Mac version?**

A: My Fault, I owe you this one, I don't know how to compile a mac version, even them I don't have a mac computer to test out, sorry.

**Q: After the full mod released, what you will do?**

A: I Dunno, Probably add new content, since now I learned how to add and edit the source code, or work one another project.

**Q: your English looks a little weird... Why?**

A: English Is not my native language
